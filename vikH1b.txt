I have started working for XX client as a full time employee from April 2019 at peoria IL location in H1B visa and my residing address is in Bloomington where i commute to office everyday. I have a travel plan coming up on March-13 to India where I have to get the visa stamping(for first time on March-24) for H1b. I've requested for the H1B documents from my employer's immigration team and to my surprise it seems like they have filed LCA and all other documents for a different location(Chicago). When asked about that they are suggesting to travel with my current plan and they are planning to apply for amendment once I'm back(They said its a miss communication within their team that made them to file for a wrong location). My question here is, Is it safe to go for stamping without an approved amendment(with my approved LCA with wrong location)? or can I go to stamping with amendment receipt if filed before i start here? or Can i just ask to file a new LCA with the changes and go for the interview and file the amendment once i come back?
